The person or people behind this project likely\\nspent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update\\nmerged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux, when\\nan eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.\\n\\n### Further Reading\\n\\nBackdoor found in widely used Linux utility targets encrypted SSH connections\\n\\n\"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we\\'ve seen described in\\nthe open, and it\\'s a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized\\nupstream in a widely used library,\" software and cryptography engineer Filippo\\nValsorda said of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.\\n\\nResearchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here\\'s what we know so\\nfar.\\n\\n**What is xz Utils?**\\n\\nxz Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression\\non virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. xz Utils\\nprovides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all\\nkinds of operations. xz Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making\\nthis component even more crucial.\\n\\n**What happened?**\\n\\nAndres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL\\nofferings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system\\nwas experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging\\nin to devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too\\nmany CPU cycles and were generating errors with valgrind, a utility for\\nmonitoring computer memory.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThrough sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the\\nproblems were the result of updates that had been made to xz Utils. On Friday,\\nFreund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the\\nresult of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression\\nsoftware.\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to overstate the complexity of the social engineering and the inner\\nworkings of the backdoor. Thomas Roccia, a researcher at Microsoft, published\\na graphic on Mastodon that helps visualize the sprawling extent of the nearly\\nsuccessful endeavor to spread a backdoor with a reach that would have dwarfed\\nthe SolarWinds event from 2020.\\n\\nEnlarge\\n\\n**What does the backdoor do?**\\n\\nMalicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the\\nsoftware functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to\\nmake remote SSH connections. Anyone in possession of a predetermined\\nencryption key could stash any code of their choice in an SSH login\\ncertificate, upload it, and execute it on the backdoored device. No one has\\nactually seen code uploaded, so it\\'s not known what code the attacker planned\\nto run. In theory, the code could allow for just about anything, including\\nstealing encryption keys or installing malware.\\n\\n**Wait, how can a compression utility manipulate a process as security\\nsensitive as SSH?**\\n\\nAny library can tamper with the inner workings of any executable it is linked\\nagainst. Often, the developer of the executable will establish a link to a\\nlibrary that\\'s needed for it to work properly. OpenSSH, the most popular sshd\\nimplementation, doesn’t link the liblzma library, but Debian and many other\\nLinux distributions add a patch to link sshd to systemd, a program that loads\\na variety of services during the system bootup. Systemd, in turn, links to\\nliblzma, and this allows xz Utils to exert control over sshd.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n**How did this backdoor come to be?**\\n\\nIt would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone\\nwith the username JiaT75 made their first known commit to an open source\\nproject. In retrospect, the change to the libarchive project is suspicious,\\nbecause it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that has long been\\nrecognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.\\n\\nThe following year, JiaT75 submitted a patch over the xz Utils mailing list,\\nand, almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar\\njoined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of\\nxz Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with\\nthe support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a\\npresence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to\\nmaintain the project.\\n\\nIn January 2023, JiaT75 made their first commit to xz Utils. In the months\\nfollowing, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in\\nxz Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins\\' contact information with\\ntheir own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open source software for\\nvulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz\\ndisable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from\\ndetecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to xz Utils.\\n\\nIn February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of\\nxz Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or\\nothers appealed to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the\\nupdates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into\\nthe following releases, according to security firm Tenable:\\n\\n**Distribution** | **Advisory** | **Notes**  \\n---|---|---  \\nFedora Rawhide | _https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-\\nfedora-41-and-rawhide-users_ | Fedora Rawhide is the development distribution\\nof Fedora Linux  \\nFedora 41 | _https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-\\nfedora-41-and-rawhide-users_ |  \\nDebian testing, unstable and experimental distributions versions\\n5.5.1alpha-0.1 to 5.6.1-1. | _https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-\\nannounce/2024/msg00057.html_ |  \\nopenSUSE Tumbleweed and openSUSE MicroOS |\\n_https://news.opensuse.org/2024/03/29/xz-backdoor/_ | Backdoored version of xz\\nwas included in Tumbleweed and MicroOS between March 7 and March 28  \\nKali Linux | _https://www.kali.org/blog/about-the-xz-backdoor/_ | Backdoored\\nversion of xz was included in Kali Linux (xz-utils 5.6.0-0.2) between March 26\\nand March 28  \\n  \\nThere’s more about Tan and the timeline here.\\n\\nPage: 1 2 Next ->\\n\\n#### reader comments\\n\\n209\\n\\nDan Goodin Dan Goodin is Senior Security Editor at Ars Technica, where he\\noversees coverage of malware, computer espionage, botnets, hardware hacking,\\nencryption, and passwords.
